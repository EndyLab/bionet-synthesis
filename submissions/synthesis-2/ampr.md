# AmpR

Ampicillin resistance biobrick part from the iGEM registry.

## Long Description

## Justification
The big five antibiotic resistance cassettes are used across synthetic biology. Having an open-source suite of the resistance markers will allow for easy assembly of open-source plasmids, and for easy modification of existing plasmids to be compatible with other markers.
