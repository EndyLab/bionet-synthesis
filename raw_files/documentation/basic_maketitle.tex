\section{Bovine Kappa Casein}%
Bovine Kappa Casein  \newline%
Location: Specific to mammary gland, secreted outside cell membrane to milk\newline%
Function: stabilizes micelle formation and prevents casein precipitation in milk \newline%
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02668\newline%
{-} Sequence Translated from amino acids to nucleotides through IDT using Yeast optimization \newline%
Why Milk Proteins? With a growing population, the demand for consumption of animal products will also continue to rise. There are sustainability issues for the land requirements needed for cows. The purpose of these genes is to produce them through Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and test whether there is any potential in producing these animal proteins (complete in essential amino acids) efficiently and sustainably through bioengineering organisms like Yeast.) %

\section{Clarkia breweri S{-}Linalool Synthase}%
Clarkia breweri S{-}Linalool Synthase\newline%
Function: Fragrant terpene part of the sweet scent of flowers \newline%
Reaction: Geranyl diphosphate + H2O = (3S){-}linalool + diphosphate.\newline%
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96376\newline%
Sequence Translated from amino acids to nucleotides through IDT using Yeast optimization \newline%
Why? A fragrance is easy to detect which is good for biolabs lacking expensive measuring instruments. The gene can be used as a practicing tool for beginners in synthetic biology. Yeast has an inherent terpene synthesis (MVA) pathway. %

\section{Oscimum basilicum Gernaiol synthase}%
These two genes belong to the iridoid pathway in Picrorhiza kurrooa{-} a highly endangered medicinal plant. In order to engineer heterologous hosts to produce a synthetic biology platform for producing picrosides, I have selected two genes to test the functionality fo a novel P. kurrooa P450 and engineer N. benthamiana to produce picrosides.%

\section{Mentha aquatica R{-}linalool synthase}%
Mentha aquatica R{-}linalool synthase\newline%
S{-}Linalool has olfactory threshold at 7.4 ppb whereas R form has 0.8 ppb. R{-}Linalool production is an enantiomer of S{-}Linalool. \newline%
Function: Main component of lavender essential oil \newline%
Location: Produced in the cytoplasm \newline%
